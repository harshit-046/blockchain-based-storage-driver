✅ SUCCESSFUL TEST RESULTS:
   • All files can be created and read correctly
   • Blockchain verification passes
   • File integrity verification passes
   • Logs show all operations
   • No error messages in terminals
   • Blockchain.json contains valid data

❌ POTENTIAL ISSUES:
   • IPFS connection errors → Check IPFS daemon
   • Permission errors → Check file permissions
   • Import errors → Install missing packages
   • Mount errors → Check FUSE installation
   • Hash mismatches → Check IPFS connectivity

🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING:
   • Check logs.txt for detailed error messages
   • Ensure IPFS daemon is running on localhost:5001
   • Verify all Python dependencies are installed
   • Check that mountpoint directory exists and is empty
   • Ensure sufficient disk space for blockchain.json

🚀 ADVANCED TESTS (Optional):
   • Test with very large files (>10MB)
   • Test concurrent file operations
   • Test system recovery after crash
   • Test with different IPFS configurations
   • Test blockchain corruption detection
   • Performance benchmarking
   • Memory usage monitoring
